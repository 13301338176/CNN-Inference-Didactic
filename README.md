# CNN-Inference-Didactic

In this repositary you will find a C library written with didactic intentions using straight-forward algorithms, simple structures and lots of comments. To go along with it I have also included a sample "vanilla" convolutional neural network which serves no other purpose than to showcase some of the different tensor operations. You can find the neural network's Python code and the extraction of its weights in **weights_to_txt.py** and its C implementation, using the library, in **vanilla_0_inference.c**.
